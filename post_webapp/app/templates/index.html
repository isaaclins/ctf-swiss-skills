    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>POST is your premier partner for interstellar logistics, delivering cargo across planets, moons, and orbital stations with unparalleled efficiency—or at least, that’s what our AI overlords tell us to say. Founded in 3015 by a caffeine-addicted spacer who thought "shipping should be as fast as my coffee brews," we’ve been zipping packages across the galaxy ever since.</p>
    
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>To connect the galaxy through reliable shipping, ensuring colonies thrive with timely supplies—and to boldly deliver where no drone has delivered before! Whether it’s freeze-dried Martian tacos or a spare warp coil, we’ve got your back (and your cargo hold).</p>
    
    <h3>Services</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cargo transport between Earth, Mars, and beyond—yes, even that sketchy asteroid belt bar.</li>
        <li>Real-time tracking for all shipments—because who doesn’t love stalking their package like it’s a reality holo-show?</li>
        <li>Specialized handling for rare minerals, perishables, and that one guy’s pet lunar rock collection.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Our fastest delivery? 3.2 light-seconds—beat that, quantum entanglement!</li>
        <li>Our mascot, Zippy the Cosmic Courier, once accidentally shipped himself to Pluto. He’s fine now, just a bit chilly.</li>
        <li>We’ve lost exactly 42 packages to black holes. Coincidence? We blame the Hitchhiker’s Guide.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Why Choose POST?</h3>
    <p>Because we’re the only shipping company brave (or crazy) enough to take on the asteroid belt’s pirate bots, the bureaucracy of Saturn’s ring tolls, and that one glitchy AI customs officer on Europa. Plus, our delivery drones come with free sass—upgrade to premium for sarcastic delivery updates!</p>
